Here are the answers to your assignment questions in a clear and simple way, including examples in C.

1. What do you mean by structures?
A structure (struct) in C is a user-defined data type that allows you to store multiple variables of different data types under one name.

It groups related data together.

Useful when you need to represent a record (like a student, employee, book, etc.).

Example

struct Student {
    int roll_no;
    char name[20];
    float marks;
};
2. What do you mean by an array & pointer array?
✅ Array
An array is a collection of elements of the same data type, stored in continuous memory.

Example:

int numbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
✅ Pointer Array (Array of Pointers)
An array that stores memory addresses (pointers) instead of data values.

Example:

int a = 10, b = 20, c = 30;
int *ptr[3] = {&a, &b, &c};
Here, ptr is an array containing addresses of a, b, and c.

3. Compare two structure variables using comparison operators (equal & not equal)
You cannot directly compare structures using == or != operators in C.

Instead, you compare each member individually.

Example Program

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

struct Student {
    int roll;
    char name[20];
};

int main() {
    struct Student s1 = {1, "John"};
    struct Student s2 = {1, "John"};

    // Comparing structures manually
    if (s1.roll == s2.roll && strcmp(s1.name, s2.name) == 0) {
        printf("Structures are EQUAL\n");
    } else {
        printf("Structures are NOT EQUAL\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
4. Perform arithmetic operations on structures
C does not support arithmetic operations directly on structures.
But you can perform arithmetic on structure members.

Example Program

#include <stdio.h>

struct Numbers {
    int num1;
    int num2;
};

int main() {
    struct Numbers n = {10, 5};

    printf("Addition: %d\n", n.num1 + n.num2);
    printf("Subtraction: %d\n", n.num1 - n.num2);
    printf("Multiplication: %d\n", n.num1 * n.num2);
    printf("Division: %d\n", n.num1 / n.num2);

    return 0;
}
